Due to a technical limitation the beam is created using particles (Plugins are server-side so it's not possible to do things like an overlay)

## Usage
Just look at where you want to ping and sneak fast two times in a row

To install just put the latest [release jar](https://github.com/Huber1/MinecraftPing/releases) into your plugins folder and restart the server to make it work

## Versions
- 1.18, 1.19
